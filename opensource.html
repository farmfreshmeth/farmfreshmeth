<h1>What?</h1>

<div class="body-text">
  Sometimes we think up ideas for funny bits, but we're not equipped to see
  them through.  So, we post those ideas on our social media accounts to
  inspire others.
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  You are free to use those ideas for whatever you want.
  You don't have to give us credit, but if you want to, we ask that you
  work the words "farm", "fresh", and "meth" (in that order) into your
  bit and that you notify us of where we can see the final product.
</div>

<div class="body-text">
  If you want to contribute an idea, Tweet it with @farmfreshmeth.

  Enjoy!
